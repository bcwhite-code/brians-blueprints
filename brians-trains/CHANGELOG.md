# Brian's Train Changelog

History, in brief.

## V4.20

- Updated non-LTN requester to properly export amount short.

## V4.19

- Added negative "0" channel amounts for request shortage.
- Set train-limit on depots so trains won't queue for them.

## V4.18

- Fixed (again) bad signals in 4-track "L".

## V4.17

- Fixed more bad signals in 4-track "L".

## V4.16

- Fixed bad signal in 4-track "L".

## V4.15

- Fixed weird present of two extra tanker cars in 8-tanker blueprint.

## V4.14

- Changed icons for "LTN Support" book so it won't get completely dropped if mod isn't installed. Those blueprints can be adapted to non-LTN designs by changing the stops.

## V4.13

- Fixed LTN wiring in depot hubs' train fuel stations so it works with the "use signals" option.

## V4.12

- Fixed more wiring on train-fed LTN Depot.

## V4.11

- Fixed wiring on train-fed LTN Depot.

## V4.10

- Fixed missing red wires with fuel info on Logistics Depot Hub.
- Fixed some wiring on tanker stations.
- Increased requester "provide" threshold so overfill can't change it into a provider.

## V4.9

- Fixed depot blueprints for Factorio 1.1 power lines.

## V4.8

- Restricted LTN network IDs so other networks can co-exist. Stops are ID 255 (bits 0 to 7) and depots are ID 65535 (bits 0 to 15) to cover many options while leaving adequate unused bits for outside definition.

## V4.7

- Fixed green wire in 8-tanker requester

## V4.6

- Fixed wire in updated 8-car provider (left input).

## V4.5

- Improved non-LTN station designs. (see live doc).

## V4.4

- Added support for non-LTN use (see "Life without LTN" in live doc linked at top).
- [Combed](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/power-grid-comb) station electrical wires.

## V4.3

- Changed "average" dividers by one (96 -> 95 for providers, 96 -> 97 for requesters). This eliminates the brief (1-2 items on one lane) stalls that occur at full speed.
- Removed extra rail from 2W U-turn.
- Saved with Factorio v1.1.5. I hope that's not a problem for those still on 1.0.0.

## V4.2

- changed LTN station limits to use "stacks" instead of absolute amounts
- removed unnecessary chain signals; absolute grid makes them unnecessary
- added grid to double-exit blueprint

## V4.1

- cleaned schedule from player train
- made compatible with LTN "use signals"
- green wire now multiplexed
- add grid to station loops
- fixed alignment of stackers for 4-station loops

## V4.0

- Improved signaling on all "round" junctions lets trains get closer before stopping. Performance improvement is about 15%.
- Improved signalling on station loops also lets trains get closer while waiting and prioritizes moving trains over starting trains so as to not create logjams.
- Added "wide" double-track designs that can be later upgraded to quad-track without having to worry about the new outside track conflicting with existing stations.
- Added "city block" designs for all three rail sizes.
- Widened safe crossings to make it easier to drive vehicles.
- Added (non-LTN) station designs for player train and remote construction sites.
- Added blueprints for the train-rate display seen in my [video](https://youtu.be/gmV0mkNOkSA).

**===> V3 Blueprints are incompatible with V2 blueprints! Do not mix them! <===**

## [V3.6](http://backgroundexposure.com/files/brians-trains-v3.txt)

- Added missing red wire on 4 car provider (right input)
- Use the "V3.6" link to get this version.

## V3.5

- Subdivided blueprints into internal books of related designs.
- Added missing 2-car to 4-blue requester stations.
- Added blueprints for 2-tanker and 4-tanker trains.

## V3.4

- Increased "siding" station track distance from main rail so "requester" stations will fit.
- (Also provides better compatibility with "[aux](https://factorioprints.com/view/-M5PZvxZVXEZnmg4V7Hy)" station designs.)

## V3.3

- Fixed quad-rail placeholder so that all signals are present when two are crossed.
- Removed unnecessary rails from quad-rail u-turn.

## V3.2

- Added early LTN Depot that fuels engines from a coal train instead of logistics.

## V3.1

- Stretched all station tracks to match new size.
- Upgraded quad-rail high-capacity station to make use of new space. Now 15% faster! Sustained rates >42 trains per minute.

## V3.0

- Rebuilt to 110x110 global, "absolute" grid for easier, error-free placement of track.
- Junctions and straights are now the same size.
