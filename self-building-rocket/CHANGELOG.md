# Self Building Rocket Blueprint Changelog

Don't update to a new version that is different in the first or second digit while in the process of building the factory. Though very similar, they are **not** compatible!

## 1.3.2

- Restored recipes lost during the 1.3.1 export. Reason unknown.
- Fixed underground belt for bots frames in #5.

## 1.3.1

- Fixed absolute grid origin to be the same in all layers.

## 1.3.0

- Updated from received feedback about various small problems.

## 1.2.0

- Manage resources for crafting of construction bots.
- Prioritize silo assembler once it starts.

## 1.1.6

- Fixed some more missing power lines.
- Fixed a badly rotated belt.
- Added blueprints for steam power.

## v1.1.5

- Restored yet another missing red wire.
- Fixed some logic that stops wasting processors.
- Fixed problem where prod-1 production could be stopped too soon.

## v1.1.4

- Restored missing red wire to rocket silo.

## v1.1.3

- Fixed more missing power wires (only in Step#7).

## v1.1.2

- Fixed missing power wires due to Factorio 1.0->1.1 upgrade of my ghost templates.
  (It's possible I missed some -- please report via Discord if something isn't connected.)

## v1.1.1

- Better iron-stick delivery to purple science.
- Prioritize red circuits to blue-science when purple-science is ahead.
- Removed some underground pipe ghosts in step#3 blueprint.
- _Don't re-apply Stage#7 over Stage#7 of a previous version. It's fine to apply it over Stage#6, though._

## v1.1.0

- Improved steel availability to blue science.
- Improved performance and reduced waste from beacon assembler.

## v1.0.5

- Added red-circuit cache for purple science. Filled during build-out and used later.

## v1.0.4

- Added speed modules to sulfur plant.
- Added speed modules to Beacon assembler.
- Closer shutoff of LDS and Processors to reduce waste.
- Added a comment to the silo circuity.
- Added a manually-placed power-pole so Stage#6 can better build small power poles.
- Fixed Stage#4 coal belt that is supposed to be single-lane.

## v1.0.3
