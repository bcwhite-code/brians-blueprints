- fixed chem-plant production in Mall and double steel production in Basic Parts.

## v1.4.0

- updated battery/bot block.

## v1.3.1

## v1.3.0

- fixed Electronics block.

- There are no silver plates without Metallurgy #1c and no silver ore except from the processing of sludge. Red circuits are going to be slow coming. I'm going to see if I can switch Silver Plates from the 1c block to the 1b block.

- some fixes to the Metallurgy blocks and the Steam Power block, plus some other clean-up here and there.

## v1.1.2

- released with minor fixes.

## v0.35

- Added labs to science, enough for full infinite research.
- Added train request for white science (even though nothing yet produces it.)
- Improved logic in Sludge & Thermal (so it doesn't stop).
- Improved logic in Waste Processing block (so it doesn't overflow).

## v0.34

## v0.23

- Extended Electronics block to make basic+logic boards and robot brains of all levels!

## v0.22

- Added Electronic Parts block!
- Bring steel pipe to induction/cast-2 assemblers in Mall.
- Added light/heavy oil export from Oil & Gas block.
- Changed inserters in steam-power 1/2 block to be "burner" inserters as they'll continue even in a brown-out so such doesn't become a black-out.

## v0.21

- Added Oil & Gas block!
- Fixed Induction-Furance-3 in Metallurgy 1b to be -1's.
- Added steel-pipe assembler for chem-furnace-1 in Mall.

- Added Bricks block!

## v0.15
